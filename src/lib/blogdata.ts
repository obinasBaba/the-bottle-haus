      <h2> About the French 75</h2>

      <p>
        The French 75 is a gin-based champagne cocktail and one of the most refreshing drinks you
        can mix up. It's also a great way to get a buzz in front of your stuffy friends and family.
        This classic cocktail was created during WWI at the New York Bar in Paris, which later
        became Harry's New York Bar, where it was first named after the French 75mm field gun. The
        drink rose to popularity during Prohibition when Harry's Bar opened in New York City.

        If you've never had this cocktail before, you should know that it's delicious and a little
        but dangerous. If you're not paying attention, you'll be under the table before you know it.
        One sip at a time.

      <h2> What to look for when choosing a gin</h2>

      <p>

        The gin you use in your French 75 makes a difference. The best gins for this cocktail are
        ones with big, robust flavors, since this drink is often served as an aperitif before
        dinner.

        In the United States, London dry gins are most common, but they can vary widely in style.
        Some have bright citrus notes, while others are earthy and juniper-forward. Your choice will
        depend on your own personal taste and what you plan to pair it with — some gins work better
        with certain foods than others.
      </p>

      <p>
        A good rule of thumb is to use the same gin you'd use in a martini. It will be a London Dry
        style, meaning it's made from juniper and other botanicals, with very little sugar added to
        the spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The juniper flavor makes the gin taste like Christmas trees or pine cones. It's also what
        gives it that characteristic "ginny" quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some examples of London Dry gins are Tanqueray, Beefeater and Bombay Sapphire. Any of these
        would make a great French 75!
